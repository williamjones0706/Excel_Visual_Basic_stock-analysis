Write a macro that will replace any Hornets with Bugs (keep in mind that you should have a limited supply of bugs)
If you run out of bugs, then replace the remaining hornets with Bees (you also have a limited supply of bees) available to replace the Hornets
If you run out of Bugs or Bees provide the user with the message: "Oh no! We still have hornets..."
Count the number of Hornets found and display the number to your user in the form of a message box.

You are in charge of finding our winners for a local lotto drawing.
The results are, in order:

They should be placed in winning order of First, Second, Third.
